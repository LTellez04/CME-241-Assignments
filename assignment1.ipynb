        "\n",
        "In the classic childhood game of Snakes and Ladders, all players start to the left of square 1 (call this position 0) and roll a 6-sided die to represent the number of squares they can move forward. The goal is to reach square 100 as quickly as possible. Landing on the bottom rung of a ladder allows for an automatic free-pass to climb, e.g. square 4 sends you directly to 14; whereas landing on a snake's head forces one to slide all the way to the tail, e.g. square 34 sends you to 6. Note, this game can be viewed as a Markov Process, where the outcome is only depedent on the current state and not the prior trajectory. In this question, we will ask you to both formally describe the Markov Process that describes this game, followed by coding up a version of the game to get familiar with the RL-book libraries.\n",

        "Let $n$ be the number of players in the game. Then the state space $\\mathcal{S}$ is described by any n-tuple in $\\{0,...,100\\}^n$ (i.e with integer entries from 0 to 100), with the set of terminal states $\\mathcal{T}$ described by the states with any entry equal to 100. The reward function $R$ is a deterministic function of the state, with 1 reward given for winning the game (i.e reaching a terminal state where your integer is 100) and 0 reward otherwise. The action distribution cannot be changed by the player, and is entirely determined by the state (where the player is and if the game is not over) and by the presumably uniform distribution of the die rolls."

When $k$ is at a ladder bottom, then $f(k)$ gives the ladder top, while if $k$ is at a snake head $f(k)$ is at the tail of the snake. Finally if $k > 100$ then $f(k) := f(100 - (k \\mod 100))$. We can now compactly represent the transition probability for player $j$'s turn from position $k$ in a nonterminal state $S$ as $$ p_j(k,k') = |f^{-1}(k')\\cap\\{k+1,k+2,...,k+6\\}|/6 $$ "

This means that $V^*$ is constant over $s$ hence we get the reduced equation $$ V^* = \\max_{a \\in [0,1]}[  a(1-a) + (1-a)(1+a) + \\frac{1}{2} V^* ] \\implies V^* = 2\\max_{a \\in [0,1]}[  - 2a^2 + a + 1] $$ To find this maximum we differentiate the expression to be maximized $$-4a^* + 1 = 0 \\implies a^* = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies V^* = \\frac{5}{4}$$"
